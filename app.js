// SHIT TEST, IN THEIR DNA, MAN. YOU GOTTA KNOW THEY ARE ALWAYS TESTING YOU, PLEASE, PLEASE DONT FAIL THEM OR AT LEAST BE AWARE OF THEM.

// YOU NEED A PLAN..



// GRACIAS DINERO :) . Everytime you use it, no matter on what, be thankful.

// Start making better decisions, first for yourself and then the group around you, guide
